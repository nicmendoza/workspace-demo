### 1 day Proof of Concept of Workspace UI
This was a quick prototype I threw together based on a discussion of a workspace. Here's a [live demo](https://nicmendoza.github.io/workspace-demo/build/).

This wasn't meant to be a particularly clean implementation, and I also used a few new libraries for fun. Uses React (bootstrapped via CRA) w/ Redux, Tailwind CSS, Ag Grid for the grid/table view, KonvaJS.
